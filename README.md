# Set-Up Linux

Most this repository is instructions, commands, and little scripts for my preferred linux set-up. 
A minority of the content is technical references and common commands for different tools.
The repository serves as either a personal reference for me (the author) or reference of last resort for others.
The instructions are not always as well-written, complete, or up-to-date as I'd like... but something is often better than nothing.
