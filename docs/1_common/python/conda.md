# Conda Environment Manager

Conda is intertwined with proprietary systems; thus, I am not partial to it. 
Unfortunately, it is often a dependency I cannot escape. 

#  Install Python via Conda. 

[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) includes python and the conda installer, no/minimal extra packages.
The [install instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/linux/) say to do something like the following:

`bash ./miniconda.sh -b -p $STORE/opt/.miniconda`

Add to environ

`source $STORE/opt/.miniconda/bin/activate`
